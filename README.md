## Skinning

### FBX 

Blender adds an empty node called "Armature" on export.  
This is problematic when a FBX file has been created e.g. in Maya (exports without such a root node).  
Blender has options what to do with the root (Null, Root, LimbNode) but neither of those skips the object.  

Unreal removes "Armature" root nodes by default to counter Blender behaviour.  
Unity does not remove "Armature" root nodes and doesn't have an option for it.

> FBX bones seems to be -X aligned, Blenderâ€™s are Y aligned  

### Skinned glTF Import in Blender

Need to set bone orientation manually, not use the default  

## Animations

- FBX: AnimStacks + AnimLayer + AnimCurveNode (AnimLayer rarely used / usually only one)  
- Blender: NLA strips + actions  
- glTF: animations + channels  
- USD: clipSets + timeSamples (without clip sets, only one animation is supported)  
- Unity: AnimationClip + AnimationCurve (Animators can blend between multiple AnimationClips)  
- Unreal: AnimSequence + AnimCurves  
- three.js: AnimationClip + KeyframeTrack (Mixers can blend between multiple AnimationClips)  

### Interpolation Types
- Unity: per keyframe  
- glTF: per channel  
- Blender: per keyframe  

## Hard Workflows

- import skinned + animated glTF file into Blender, make changes, export again
  - need to be careful with bone orientations, Blender likes flipping into its own format but doesn't allow flipping back
  - working in Blender is a bit annoying as bones look "wrong"

- import skinned + animated FBX file into Blender, make changes, export again
  - hierarchy will change if original FBX wasn't created in Blender
  - impossible to use in external tools since that extra hierarchy node breaks existing animation clips in other softwares (e.g. Unity)

- bake lightmaps in Blender that take Filmic into account and export to other softwares (bake the look transform in)  
  - image editor has an option to bake LUT into textures
